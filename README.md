Project Overview
GPUverse is a decentralized marketplace for AI compute power, enabling individuals and businesses to rent or lease high-performance GPUs securely through blockchain technology.

With the increasing demand for AI model training and the high cost of dedicated GPU infrastructure, GPUverse provides a peer-to-peer network where:

GPU owners can list their idle GPUs for rent.

AI developers and researchers can rent GPUs on demand at competitive rates.

Key Features
Blockchain-Powered Transactions – Secure and transparent smart contract-based rental agreements.

Decentralized GPU Listing and Renting – Direct peer-to-peer exchange without intermediaries.

Automated Payments – Smart contracts ensure secure fund transfers between renters and owners.

Remote Access – Renters can access rented GPUs via SSH/VNC after a successful transaction.

This platform aims to democratize access to high-performance computing, making AI development more cost-effective and accessible.
